        <h1>Welcome to Dom's Gap Year Blog!</h1>
        <p >On this blog, I will be inconsistently updating what I'm doing during my Gap Year in Australia (and another country I'm yet to be told about)</p><br><br>
      
        <p>January 18th - I've arrived at YWAM Toowoomba and my - the heat is incredible, not only with the weather but also with the warmer welcome I have received on arrival. Everyone is very kind and I have already jammed on the piano with most of the DTS leaders. The base is sat on the edge of a ridge within Toowoomba which gives the beautiful view you can see in the photos section of my blog :) we are having tea in a couple of minutes and as people continue to arrive in the next few days, I look forward to meet them all. I hope all of you are well in Warwickshire and everywhere else and good morning - it's 17:07 over here :)</p>
