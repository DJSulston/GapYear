          January 18th - I've arrived at YWAM Toowoomba and my, the heat is incredible, not only with the weather but also with the warmer welcome I have received on arrival. The base is sat on the edge of a ridge within Toowoomba which gives the beautiful view you can see in the photos section of my blog :) we are having tea in a couple of minutes and as people continue to arrive in the next few days, I look forward to meet them all. I hope all of you are well in Warwickshire and everywhere else and good morning - it's 17:07 over here :)
