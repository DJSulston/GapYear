        <h1>Welcome to Dom's Gap Year Blog!</h1>
        <p >On this blog, I will be inconsistently updating what I'm doing during my Gap Year in Australia (and another country I'm yet to be told about)</p><br><br>

        <p><bold><strong>January 25th</strong></bold> It's Thursday morning and I've realised I haven't updated this in a while so I'm making use of a bit of my 'quiet time' to update you all. The lectures have begun! Focussed on the Heart and Character of God, they have been teaching me about who He is and how to respond to Him properly. The speaker, Jason, is truly inspirational and is a true teacher, meaning that my notes on his lessons have recently amassed 4000 words (!!). Overall, I am learning slowly how much God loves us and am also learning the different aspects of His character, be that his friendliness, loyalty, steadfastness or strength. There is a lot more to learn but I am ready and excited for it. Another great thing to have happened recently was that I have been asked to play with the staff band tonight which is a true honor. I am so excited to play with them - the worship here has been amazing so far and I am really looking forward to administer that unto others. Yet another great thing to NOT have happened over the DTS so far is that I haven't sunburnt! Praise Him. </p>

        <p><bold><strong>January 21st</strong></bold> - Everyone has now arrived on camp and we are already growing together as a team. There as so many cultures within the camp (which I love), with people coming from Switzerland, Germany, America (mostly), Singapore and of course the UK. Being able to be around people from so many different backgrounds is brilliant, but having your accent copied by 99% of the team isn't too enjoyable. Yesterday we had a park trip into the city of Toowoomba, which was also incredibly beautiful, where we bonded further ready for the first lessons to begin tomorrow. Photos are to follow, but overall, I am incredibly excited to see what the DTS school has to bring. </p>

        <p><bold><strong>January 18th</strong></bold> - I've arrived at YWAM Toowoomba and my - the heat is incredible, not only with the weather but also with the warmer welcome I have received on arrival. Everyone is very kind and I have already jammed on the piano with most of the DTS leaders. The base is sat on the edge of a ridge within Toowoomba which gives the beautiful view you can see in the photos section of my blog :) we are having tea in a couple of minutes and as people continue to arrive in the next few days, I look forward to meet them all. I hope all of you are well in Warwickshire and everywhere else and good morning - it's 17:07 over here :)</p>
