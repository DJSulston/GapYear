        <p><bold><strong>February 12th</strong></bold> - Sorry I haven't updated in a while, I've been very busy! I celebrated my 19th birthday on the 31st of January and it was brill - Mum somehow organised for cake to be bought for everyone which was really great and some of my friends bought me a big pack of english tea! It was strange being away from home on my birthday but it was so cool to see how well I've got to know some of the people here already so that they would buy me presents - I wasn't going to mention I had my birthday coming up at all before I had arrived! The past week of lectures have been based upon learning about our identity in Christ. We have been learning about his heart for us and what defines us as a man or as a woman in Him. Tears were shed and it was an amazing week overall. Our outreach locations have also been revealed and I'm officially going to Thailand to help prevent sex trafficking! Not much more is known about what we'll do, but I know that we're going to do some great work, plus the team I have is amazing, ableit slightly female dominated. Another fun thing that has been happening recently is that we're being hit by a heatwave at the moment, meaning that this current week should have an average temperature of 35 degrees celcius. I have also recently become a tomato in the sun which has also been very enjoyable. Anyways, I'm sorry for the long wait for the next post and as ever I hope everything is great back in Snowy Warwickshire!</p>

        <p><bold><strong>January 30th</strong></bold> - Hello again all! The first week of lectures is over and we are now in the second day of learning about how to listen to God, taught by the base director Michael Bingham. It has been very inspirational to hear his story and how he came to direct a YWAM base in Australia from living in England and Turkey as a child. We have also given in our first set of workbooks and journal entries which was quite fun to do - we were asked to summarise the week in our writing and I found myself writing 4 pages in 10 minutes as there was so much to say! I feel sorry for my 1 on 1, Luke, who has to work through it all. Apart from the lectures, we journeyed into the park again yesterday to see the gardens and to buy some stamps (which was unsuccessful). As you can see in my updated photos page for month 1, the gardens are very nice here and I would bet that my Mum and Dad would definitely love to visit some time. I hope that all of you are well back at home and God bless! </p>

        <p><bold><strong>January 25th</strong></bold> - It's Thursday morning and I've realised I haven't updated this in a while so I'm making use of a bit of my 'quiet time' to update you all. The lectures have begun! Focussed on the Heart and Character of God, they have been teaching me about who He is and how to respond to Him properly. The speaker, Jason, is truly inspirational and is a true teacher, meaning that my notes on his lessons have recently amassed 4000 words (!!). Overall, I am learning slowly how much God loves us and am also learning the different aspects of His character, be that his friendliness, loyalty, steadfastness or strength. There is a lot more to learn but I am ready and excited for it. Another great thing to have happened recently was that I have been asked to play with the staff band tonight which is a true honor. I am so excited to play with them - the worship here has been amazing so far and I am really looking forward to administer that unto others. Yet another great thing to NOT have happened over the DTS so far is that I haven't sunburnt! Praise Him. </p>

        <p><bold><strong>January 21st</strong></bold> - Everyone has now arrived on camp and we are already growing together as a team. There as so many cultures within the camp (which I love), with people coming from Switzerland, Germany, America (mostly), Singapore and of course the UK. Being able to be around people from so many different backgrounds is brilliant, but having your accent copied by 99% of the team isn't too enjoyable. Yesterday we had a park trip into the city of Toowoomba, which was also incredibly beautiful, where we bonded further ready for the first lessons to begin tomorrow. Photos are to follow, but overall, I am incredibly excited to see what the DTS school has to bring. </p>

        <p><bold><strong>January 18th</strong></bold> - I've arrived at YWAM Toowoomba and my - the heat is incredible, not only with the weather but also with the warmer welcome I have received on arrival. Everyone is very kind and I have already jammed on the piano with most of the DTS leaders. The base is sat on the edge of a ridge within Toowoomba which gives the beautiful view you can see in the photos section of my blog :) we are having tea in a couple of minutes and as people continue to arrive in the next few days, I look forward to meet them all. I hope all of you are well in Warwickshire and everywhere else and good morning - it's 17:07 over here :)</p>
