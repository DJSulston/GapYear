          Hello all! This is the first post I'm making on this blog, I hope it won't be the last...
        <br><br>
          I have been working at SolidSolutions for a couple of weeks now, moving me closer to being able to go for my Gap Year in Australia and Thailand.
          Working here has been very enjoyable so far, I've been learning lots about the workplace and have also gained experience in Marketing, the subject which
          I intend to take at University. 
          
          I will be working here till the end of December, so things can only get better! 
          
          Dom
